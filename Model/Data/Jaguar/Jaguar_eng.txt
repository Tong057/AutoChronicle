"Jaguar", British automobile company specializing in luxury passenger cars, part of the Ford Motor Corporation. It is headquartered in Coventry.
The company traces its origins back to the company founded in 1925 by two namesakes - William Lyons (Sir Lyons William) and William Walmsley (Sir Walmsley William) firm called Swallow Sidecar (abbreviated SS), originally specialized in the production of sidecars for motorcycles. The production of sidecars did not bring financial prosperity and Bill Lyons switched to the development of bodywork for the then famous Austin Seven, and in 1927 received an order for the production of 500 bodies. The funds received and his reputation allowed the company to establish itself in the market of body design, making them for Fiat 509A, Morris Cowley, Wolseley Hornet models. Lyons also tried his hand at designing his own cars, with a fondness for two-seater sports models. Having exhibited in the summer of 1931 at the London Motor Show two models SSI and SSII the company achieved serious success. These were followed by the Jaguar SS90 and Jaguar SS100, catchily named by Lyons himself. The Jaguar SS100 became the classic sports model of the 1940s.

In 1945, the company became known as Jaguar, as the abbreviation SS caused unwanted associations with the criminal Nazi organization. New success came to the company in 1948 at the same London Motor Show, where the new Jaguar XK120 attracted all eyes. Equipped with a 105 hp Heynes engine, this car easily reached a speed of 126 km/h and was recognized as the fastest among production cars.
