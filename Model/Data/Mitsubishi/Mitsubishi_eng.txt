"Mitsubishi" (Mitsubishi) - one of the largest Japanese corporations specializing in the production of automobiles. Mitsubishi Motors (Mitsubishi Motors), headquartered in Tokyo, is a division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries).
"Mitsubishi" was founded by Yataro Iwasaki (Yataro Iwasaki) in 1873 originally as a shipbuilding and ship repair company, even during the lifetime of its founder, spread the scope of his interests in all sorts of technical innovations of the time. In 1875, after several name changes, it became Mitsubishi Mail Steamship Company (Mitsubishi Mail Steamship Company) - this is how the ancestor of all modern Mitsubishi companies appeared. The first cars "Mitsubishi Motors" "Model A" (1917), in many ways resembled Ford's cars. In 1921 their production was discontinued, because in Japan the demand for passenger cars was small.

Since 1924 the production of heavy trucks of large capacity, buses with the brand Fuso began. Garbage trucks and watering machines were produced for the needs of Tokyo.

In 1935 the first Japanese bus with a diesel engine was made here. After the devastation caused by World War II "Mitsubishi" produced scooters and three-wheeled delivery vehicles, and buses appeared again in 1946, and in 1947 - with an electric engine.

By the end of 1945 Mitsubishi, in addition to shipping, was engaged in shipbuilding, banking, transportation services, mining, real estate, chemical production and much, much more.

In 1946, "Mizushima" appeared - a small, reliable and inexpensive three-wheeled car, ideal for transportation of people and goods over short distances in the postwar period. Soon the car was equipped with a closed cabin for two people. The same year was the birth year of Mitsubishi's first scooter, the "Silver Pigeon." Again, the emphasis was on practicality and economy, but from a historical perspective it can be said that "Silver Pigeon" stood at the beginning of the boom of private motor transport in Japan.

In 1951, the company introduced the T31 truck with an air suspension system, and the T380 was the first Japanese truck with a convertible platform. Trucks and pickup trucks "Mitsubishi" are produced in a full range, but only light and medium duty trucks get to the European market. The most common pickup truck "L200" perfectly copes with off-road.

In the postwar period, production of passenger cars began in 1960 with a mass sedan "Mitsubishi 500".

In 1962 the Mitsubishi Minica appeared - the first 4-seater car of the first compact class. Built on the Mitsubishi 360 chassis (1960), the Minica was equipped with a two-stroke air-cooled engine with a displacement of 359 cc, which allowed it to be categorized as the least taxable.

Colt 600 - a larger and more comfortable family car (modern Colt is positioned in a different class), production of which began in 1962. In 1965, Mitsubishi Colt 800 - the first car in Japan with "fastback" layout - was presented

In 1969, Mitsubishi entered the market of higher class cars. The Colt Galant sedan was the ancestor of a whole family of high quality and prestigious cars, which won numerous victories in rally competitions and repeatedly received prizes "Car of the Year" for high consumer qualities. Among the distinctive features of the first Galant were the aerodynamic "wedge" shape of the body, which created additional downforce, and the Saturn series engine with an overhead camshaft and aluminum cylinder head. Thus the 1969 Galant, which embodied the best of modern design and technology of its time, became the progenitor of a whole segment of the automobile market in Japan.

In 1963, a new series of small buses Mitsubishi Rosa and a family of light trucks Canter appeared. By the end of the 60's Mitsubishi gains a reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality cars with the widest model range, which actively develops and introduces the latest technologies and developments in the field of automotive engineering.
