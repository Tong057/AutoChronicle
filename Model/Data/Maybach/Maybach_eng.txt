Maybach is a German automobile brand in the DaimlerChrysler Group. Produces luxury executive exclusive cars.

The history of the brand began in 1921, when a talented designer Wilhelm Maybach (Wilhelm Maybach) designed his first car model W-3. This model was equipped with a 6-cylinder engine with a volume of 5.7 liters and became the first German production car that had brakes on all wheels. The next model W-5, released in 1926, was already equipped with a 7.0 liter engine, which allowed it to reach a speed of 121 km/h.

In the spring of 1929, after barely celebrating Easter in Kanstatt, Wilhelm Maybach suddenly fell ill and died two days later. The company was taken over by his son Karl Maybach.

Karl decided to replace the 6-cylinder engine with a V12 with a displacement of 6922 cm3. For the first time it was installed on the model "DS-7".

A year later, in the middle of 1930, its successor was presented, which received the prestigious name "Zeppelin" (Zeppelin). It was the most luxurious and at that time technically perfect German car of the 30s of the last century. In those years, the design elements of the car were customized, so there were no identical cars. The model was equipped with an 8.0 liter V12 engine. (200 hp) and a 5-speed gearbox, which was replaced by a 7-speed in 1938. It went on sale in 1931 with a price of 29500 Reichsmarks. Production run: 183 cars.

The W6 was produced from 1931 to 1933 with the six-cylinder engine from the W 5. From 1934 it also came with a twin overdrive transmission (W 6 DSG). Both variants have a longer wheelbase than the W 5. Production volume: 90 cars.

The inexpensive model DSH ("Doppel-Sechs-Halbe" - "half of twelve cylinders") was produced from 1930 to 1937. It was equipped with a 5.2-liter six-cylinder engine with an output of 130 hp. Output: 34 cars. Some variants of this type were equipped with new aerodynamic bodies, which were later used for the "SW" series, produced between 1935 and 1941. It included models "SW-35", "SW-38" and "SW-42" with engines with displacement of 3.5, 3.8 and 4.2 liters respectively. These were the last Maybach models built.

Between 1921 and 1941, Maybach-Motorenbau produced about 1800 luxury cars. In addition to the cars produced, which were entered in the factory statistics, between 5 and 10 cars were built each year for exhibitions. All cars were very expensive, with no two examples among them being exactly alike. Today, there are still 152 pre-war Maybach cars in existence.

During the war years, Maybach produced exclusively tank engines (about 140 thousand units). After the war, Karl Maybach worked as a prisoner of war for the French, developing aircraft engines. In the 50's he again managed his company, producing various stationary, marine and railroad engines.

In 1961, the rights to Maybach were acquired by Daimler Benz, which in the late 90s decided to revive the forgotten brand. Thus, after 60 years of oblivion, the legendary brand experiences a second birth.

In 1997, Mercedes-Benz showed a Maybach concept car, the main ideas of which were embodied in the serial models of 2002. The Maybach name was remembered thanks to DaymlerChrysler, which launches the most luxurious sedan in the world - Mercedes-Benz Maybach - a car that clearly demonstrates the latest achievements in ease of driving, automotive aesthetics and technology.

The double name of the Mercedes-Benz Maybach automobile was formed not by chance. It is both a traditional superiority of "cars with a three-rayed star" and a tribute to the genius of automobile design Wilhelm Maybach, who developed the first Daimler cars and whose name was the most luxurious limousine of Germany in the 30s - the legendary Maybach.

The new creation of DaimlerChrysler concern exists in two versions - standard Maybach 57 with a length of 5.72 meters and extended to 6.16 meters Maybach 62. Both models are equipped with a Maybach Type 12 engine (405 kW/550 hp), which is controlled by a microcomputer and made of aluminum and magnesium alloys. The working volume is 5.5 liters and the torque is 900 Nm.

Maybach car is equipped with all conceivable electronics and simply abounds with technical novelties. Beautiful forms, luxurious design, Maybach with dignity defends the brand of luxury car. As representatives of DaimlerChrysler Group say about the new car, the very name Maybach sounds majestic and the new car should become one of the best representative cars. Maximum individuality, stylistic elegance, exclusivity and comfort - these are the characteristics of Maybach.

The cars are manufactured at plants in Germany and the United States, and orders for the cars are accepted at specialized Maybach centers located around the world. The cars will be serviced and repaired by about 50 specialized service centers. Maybach vehicles are backed by a four-year warranty that includes free repairs and free maintenance. Factory prices for the models are: 310 thousand euros for Maybach 57 and 360 thousand euros for Maybach 62.

Maybach is not for everyone.... and will never be publicly available. Maybach is exclusive, the demand for such cars has always outstripped the supply.
