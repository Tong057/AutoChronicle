"Mercedes-Benz" is a German company specializing in the production of passenger cars and engines, founded in 1926. Currently it is a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz Group. The headquarters is located in Stuttgart.
After Gottlieb Daimler's death in 1900, his son Paul and engineer Maybach continued the business of automobile production. Wilhelm Maybach, Gottlieb Daimler's faithful assistant, took over the entire management of the company. In 1900 he began to develop a new automobile. It had a classic arrangement of parts - the engine and radiator were located in front under the hood, the drive was carried out through a gearbox to the rear wheels. The new car had a 4-cylinder engine with an output of 35 hp. The first sample was made in the form of a two-seat racing car The model was named Mercedes, in honor of the daughter of one of the co-owners of the company - Austrian businessman, diplomat and avid racer Emil Jellinek. On this car of improved design at the next race in March 1899, Jellinek won the victory, glorifying for the whole world the company "Daimler" and the name "Mercedes". Since that time, all passenger cars of the firm "Daimler" were produced under the brand name Mercedes. The very first Mercedes served as a base for the creation of a more perfect car "Mercedes Simplex", which opened the era of the most powerful and comfortable cars of this brand.

Daimler decided to use the successful name and registered this name. as a trademark. in 1902. And for the personally built car of Mr. Emile Jelinek was given its own name: "Emile Jelinek-Mercedes".

In 1921 Mercedes was an innovator in the production of supercharged cars, and in 1923 made a bet on the model with a six-liter engine, which became the base for modification with a short-wheelbase chassis - Model K, and then Model S. On its basis was created a new modification - Mercedes Model SS, with a 7-liter supercharged engine with an output of 200 hp.

At this time, the most prominent engineers who created the name of the Deimler-Benz concern were Ferdinand Porsche, Fritz Nallinger and Hans Niebel.

The first production cars were equipped with a hundred horsepower engine, capable of developing up to 140 hp when the supercharger was switched on, then the working volume of this engine was increased to 7 liters, which served as a starting point for the creation of a sports car "SSK" with a 170/125 hp engine. and the speed limit of such models reached already about 160 km/hour. The next stage was the improved and shortened version "SSKL" with a 300 hp engine. - It was an absolute favorite of numerous sports competitions of those years.

In 1926, "Deimler Geselschaft" and "Benz und Co" began to negotiate a merger, and the result of their union was a three-rayed star, symbolizing the three elements, subject to the concern's machines - air, water and earth. This official emblem of the firm of Daimler Sr. became common for the new concern, and cars were supplied to the market already under the brand name "Mercedes-Benz".

So, by the 30th years, the Mercedes-Benz company established itself as a developer and manufacturer of elite cars, when Hans Niebel prepared for release the model "770 Grosser". Under the hood of this giant hid a 7.7-liter supercharged engine, so the ultra-powerful for that time car was in special demand from high-ranking customers, including ex-Kaiser Wilhelm - II and Emperor Hirohito of Japan, and the next modification of the car, launched into production only in 1938-1939, was intended exclusively for the top of the "Third Reich". It featured a modernized engine from the "770 Grosser" model, which developed 230 hp with the included compressor, plus a novelty of the concern - a completely new tubular frame, as well as independent front and rear suspensions, tested on racing cars. A rather cheap model "Type-170" with tubular frame, independent front and rear suspensions was offered to ordinary consumers, production of which began in 1931.

A few years later, the concern began to produce the first diesel cars, offering customers a 2.6-liter "Type-260 D", and the team of designers under the leadership of Porsche was already preparing for production of rear-motor models: "130 H", "150 H" and "170 H", which were of great interest (about 90000 such cars were produced until 1942) - a huge figure for the automotive market at that time.

They were produced by special orders for heads of state and government, high-ranking Nazis, as well as those to whom traditional cars seemed insufficiently ambitious, the entire Mercedes-Benz plant in Stuttgart.After World War II, Mercedes cars returned to motorsport and even won the 1952 24 Hours of Le Mans race.
