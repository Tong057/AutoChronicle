"Opel" (Adam Opel AG), German automobile company, part of the General Motors Group. Produces passenger cars, minibuses, and minivans. The headquarters is located in Russelheim, Germany.

The company was founded in 1898 by five Opel brothers and named in honor of their father, Adam Opel, the founder and owner of a factory of sewing machines and bicycles. After their father's death, his sons began producing cars, mastering production based on the chassis and engine of the French company Darracq.

The first original model "10/12PS" two-cylinder "Opel" appeared in 1902. Shortly thereafter, the "12/14" was created.

In 1903 the "20/24PS" appeared.

In 1905 Opel begins production of cars of a higher class. The model "35/40PS" with a 6.9 liter engine appeared.

Having established serial production, the Opel brothers won recognition in Germany, but a fire in 1911 destroyed their factory. However, the installation of modern equipment, made by necessity, gave the company a significant advantage over its competitors. At the enterprises of "Opel" for the first time in Europe appeared a conveyor belt.

In 1913 the company mastered the production of trucks. The Opel Laubfrosch (literally wood frog), which was called so because of its bright green color, was frankly similar to the Citroen 5 CV, but enjoyed much more success because of a well-thought-out sales strategy through its own network.

Early 20s The "8/25" model with a 2-liter engine was widely recognized. On its basis were created more powerful variants: "10/35" and "14/38" with 4-cylinder engines up to 3430 cubic centimeters.

Years of post-war inflation made Opel brothers angry and in the late 1920s they ceded their enterprise to the American concern "General Motors". With the help of overseas partners, Opel became the largest automobile firm in Europe, concentrating its efforts on the production of small and medium-sized cars. The design of the cars retained the typically European features of the early Opels: Opel Olympia and Opel Kadett. These small class models became a symbol of their time. Successful was the design of a three-ton truck Opel, produced in 1930-1940s.

Under Nazi rule, the businesses were effectively confiscated from General Motors and the company became state-owned.

After the defeat of Germany in World War II, most of the production base of "Opel" was taken to the USSR, where it formed the basis of the equipment of the Moscow plant of small cars (later AZLK), and part of it went to GAZ. However, "Opel" quickly restored and exceeded the pre-war production level. In 1947 the company resumes production of the "Olimpia" model.

1948 A modernized "Kapitan" with a 2.5-liter engine is produced.

The 1953 Opel Rekord led West Germany in sales for ten years. In 1959, the Rekord became available with a new 4-door sedan body, followed a month later by the Opel-1200.

In the 1960s, the company introduced the Opel Kapitan ("Opel Kapitan"). At the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1965, a prototype of a sports car "Opel GT" with a coupe body was presented. These models were a reaction to the increased demand for expensive cars.
