Lamborghini is owned by Audi, which in turn is a division of Volkswagen AG. It produces super cars capable of reaching speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour.
In October 1963, at the Turin Motor Show, Lamborghini, known in Italy as a tractor manufacturer, presented its first sports car Lamborghini 350 GT. It was a two-seat coupe of classic layout with a 3.5-liter V12 with an output of 347 hp. The maximum speed of the car reached 280 km/h, and acceleration to 100 km/h took 6.7 seconds. This owner of the company Ferruccio Lamborghini (Ferruccio Lamborghini) proved that he could make sports cars no worse than Enzo Ferrari, who once undeservedly offended him.

Two years later in 1965, one of the best models in the history of the company - the mid-engine Miura - made its debut. In addition to the unusual for that time layout, the car was characterized by excellent design. Within six years, 800 Miura were sold, surpassing Ferrari in popularity. Following the Miura, Lamborghini decided to create a new model for not the richest buyers.

In 1970, the company released a smaller car - "Urraco P250", with an 8-cylinder engine with a working volume of 2.5 liters of central location.

The next sensation was the Countach model. First shown at the Geneva Salon in 1971 as a "concept car" of the body company "Bertone", it was put into production only in 1974 as a successor to the "Miura", and no money was spared on it: 4-liter twelve-cylinder engine with a capacity of 365 hp of central location allowed to reach speeds of up to 300 km / hr.

At that time the so-called "family cars" of Grand Touring class became very popular. The new model was named Espada - in translation it is a blade of matador. The risk fully justified itself - the car became one of the most popular in the history of the company, its production continued until 1978. For 10 years, more than a thousand cars were produced - a record number for Lamborghini.

In March 1976 at the Geneva Motor Show the premiere of the novelty, which was christened Silhouette, took place. 3-liter V8 with an output of 250 hp accelerated the car to 260 km/h and allowed to gain 100 km/h in 7 seconds.

In the late 70's Lamborghini was in crisis. In search of additional sources of funds, the Italians undertook the development of an off-road vehicle for the U.S. army. The first prototype of such a car called Cheetah was presented for testing to the Pentagon in 1977. The car was tested in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, where it showed generally good results, but for a number of reasons was not accepted by the customer.

In 1978, as a result of joint cooperation of Lamborghini designers with the former chief designer of the company Giampaolo Dallara, one of the masterpieces of Lamborghini was born - Countach LP400S. Perfect of all Countach 5000 QV (Quattrovalvole) for the first time in the history of Lamborghini received a four-valve engine. Its power reached 455 hp, but because of the initially not the best aerodynamics 290 km/h became the limit for Countach.

In the 80s, the Lamborghini Jalpa, named in honor of the Mexican breed of fighting bulls, was born. Externally, it resembled a refined Silhouette, but had a more powerful 3.5 liter V8, developing 255 hp. At the end of 1987, the management of Chrysler, which by that time owned Lamborghini, decided to stop producing the car.

Despite the failure with Cheetah, Italians did not give up the idea of an off-roader. In 1982, a prototype LMA (Lamborghini Military Anteriore) was presented. Despite its impressive size, the LM002 (this designation was given to the production version of the car) surpassed many of its contemporaries in terms of dynamic performance.

Another masterpiece, the Diablo, was presented to the public in 1989. The company offered Diablo in several modifications, including a roadster. In 1995 - the release of Diablo SV with a hard roof and Diablo SVR, and finally in 1997 - the appearance of Diablo VT.

The last modernization of the Countach is the 25th Anniversary Countach, released in 1989 for the 25th anniversary of the founding of the company. From the technical point of view, it did not differ from its predecessor, the only changes were in the body parts, made by Lamborghini designers. In July 1990, the last Countach was assembled. In just 16 years of production, 1979 copies were produced, which made this model the best-selling in the history of Lamborghini.

On February 20, 1993, Ferruccio Lamborghini died.

On July 24, 1998, an agreement was signed to transfer the controlling stake in Lamborghini to its current owner, Audi, which in turn is a division of Volkswagen AG.

In addition to closed coupes Diablo SV and VT (all-wheel drive) in the production program of Lamborghini remains eccentric Roadster SV with a removable roof and drive only on the rear wheels.

In 2001, the company presented the successor of Diablo - Murcielago. For the first time in the history of Lamborghini the design of the car was not developed by an Italian. Murchielago received its rounded forms under the skillful hand of Belgian Luc Donckerwolk, the creator of the look of Audi Avant and Skoda Octavia. Compared to its predecessor, the new Lamborghini has become more comfortable and spacious inside. The engine is a 6.2-liter V12 with an output of 580 hp. The top speed is 330 km/h.

Murcielago was followed by "small" Lamborghini - Gallardo.

The new model, known under the code name L140, celebrated its world premiere at the Geneva Motor Show in 2003.
