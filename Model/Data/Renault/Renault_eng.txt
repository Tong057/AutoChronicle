"Renault" (Renault, Regie nationale des usines Renault), French state-owned automobile company, the largest in the country. It produces cars, trucks, and sports cars. It is headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt (a small town near Paris).
The history of the company began with the first car assembled by Louis Renault (Louis Renault) in 1898, a light voiturette (from French voiturette - wagon, cart), with a power of only 0.75 hp. The next car, known as the "Model A" with a 1.75 hp De Dion engine on a tubular frame was very successful, and Louis, together with his older brothers, organized the company "Renault Freres" (Renault Freres), already in 1899 made and sold 15 "Model A". For his car Louis designed a gearbox in which the torque to the rear wheels was transmitted not by chains, but by a shaft with cardan joints. This scheme of the main transmission remained unchanged to the present day in rear-wheel drive cars. The brothers were fond of automobile racing and racing and sports models occupied an important place in their early business.

From 1900 the company switched to the production of large and powerful cars. These are models AG1 with elegant and comfortable various bodies "capuchin", "double-faeton", "lando", rare for that time closed limousines.

In 1906 the company presented its first bus at the automobile Salon in Berlin. One of the first, in 1905, the "Renault Brothers" produced cab cars with the body of "Landolais". These cars, nicknamed "Brownings" because of their black color and their shape, became famous during the First World War, when 600 Parisian taxi-renaults were mobilized in the shortest possible time to transport 5 thousand soldiers to the Marne River. The cabs were nicknamed "Marne" after the famous battle. There is even a monument to this car. For the needs of the French army the company supplied other equipment, ships, aircraft engines (the first airplane engine was assembled in 1908). Louis Renault even designed quite successful for that time tanks.

"Renault Brothers" in the pre-war years actively cooperated with Russia. For the Emperor was made car limousine-landolais on the chassis of Renault, for the heir to the throne was purchased "Renault-Bebe", a lightweight car, extremely easy to manage and operate. Confiscated from the "exploiters" "Renault", as is known, drove Lenin. Renault taxicabs were purchased for the new socialist Moscow, Renault equipment and technologies became the basis of the KIM plant, known to us as AZLK.

In the 1930s, the original buses with an open platform appeared. Brilliant sporting results continuously accompany the firm. Louis Renault himself after the death of his brother no longer sat behind the wheel, but the company's cars invariably decorate numerous races with their presence.

Let's note a remarkable achievement of 1923 - the first crossing of the Sahara desert six-wheeled prototype. The Juve 4 model with independent front-wheel drive, which appeared in 1935, was a new word in design not appreciated in its time.

The Second World War caused significant damage to the company. The factories in Bijancourt were destroyed by Allied bombing, Louis Renault himself was accused of collaborating with the Nazi occupiers and died, disgraced, in prison.
