"Volvo" (Volvo Aktiebolaget), a Swedish company that manufactures cars and trucks, as well as engines for various purposes, and a variety of agricultural, forestry, and household equipment. It is headquartered in Gothenburg.
In Stockholm's Sturehof restaurant on July 25, 1924 - a day called Jacob's Day in the Swedish calendar - the decision to create Volvo was made. The first sample of the car prepared by the founders of the company, Assar Gabrielson (Assar Gabrielsson) and Gustaf Larson (Gustaf Larson) was called "Jakob" (Jakob), and its creation used the maximum number of components of Swedish production. The enthusiasts' endeavor was successful and in 1927, a company was founded to produce Volvo cars (from Latin volvo - I roll). In Sweden by 1935 10 thousand cars were sold.

The first trucks were produced since 1928, and since 1931 the company is the leader in Europe in production of heavy trucks.

In the early 40's the company developed relatively inexpensive models Volvo PV36 and Volvo PV51, which became "popular" in Sweden. The war prevented the sale of these models in Europe, but the first postwar years powerful advertising campaigns brought the company fame in Europe and America. The post-war Volvo PV44 model led Sweden in sales until 1953 and became the basis for the subsequent "hits" - the PV 444 and PV 544. The first mass-produced Volvo car, the PV 444, was unveiled in 1944 at the famous Volvo exhibition at the Royal Tennis Hall in Stockholm. The PV60, the first diesel-powered bus, and many other new products were also introduced.

In 1953, Volvo's first true station wagon, the Duett, was unveiled. Although the Duett was probably more suited to small businesses, it marked the beginning of Volvo's focus on family cars.

In 1956, the Volvo P 120 (sold in Scandinavian countries under the name Amazon) was launched. This car was characterized by its distinctly feminine outlines. Soon the novelty overtook the PV in popularity.

1958 Gunnar Andersson drove the PV 544 to victory in the European Rally Championship. In 1965, Volvo won the World Rally Championship.

Volvo was the first company in the world to install a three-point seat belt in a production car in 1959. The creator of the new seat belt, Niels Bohlen, received many awards, but more importantly, the belt saved millions of lives.

The product range expanded and in 1959 the Volvo P 1800 coupe sports car was introduced.

In 1966, the Volvo 144 was launched - "the safest car in the world", which was awarded the title of "Car of the Year" in the Scandinavian countries.

In 1974, the Volvo 240, a more modern and safer car than the 140 series, was introduced. It remained on sale until 1993 and was produced in the amount of 2.8 million copies.

In Holland in 1976, the Volvo 343, an important new model with a unique transmission called "Rem-Johan" (Belt-Johan), was launched. At first, the car had certain shortcomings, but in time the "childhood diseases" were cured and the model gained popularity.

Volvo was the first car manufacturer in the world to introduce catalytic converter and lambda-probe in 1976.

In 1982, the Volvo 760 became a worldwide success. At this time, the company was experiencing difficulties due to changing market trends. The Volvo 760 was followed by the more mass-market, "democratic" 740 model, which quickly won Sweden and other countries.

In 1985, the Volvo 480 ES was launched in Holland, a spectacular sports coupe that became Volvo's first front-wheel drive car. It was followed in 1988 by the Volvo 440, and a little later by the Volvo 460 sedan.

The Volvo 960 and 940 were introduced in 1990. The Volvo 960 had an aluminum six-cylinder engine, assembled at the new engine plant in Sk√∂vda and developing no less than 240 hp. The car quickly entered the fray with rivals from the luxury class - primarily German. The Volvo 940, like the earlier 740 and 240 models, became a people's car.

In 1991, the Volvo 850 was introduced to the market and was a great success. With SIPS and other innovations, Volvo showed what a reliable side impact protection system looked like.

In 1994, Volvo launched a completely new version of the Volvo 960.

The Volvo plant in Bourne in 1995 produced new contenders for success - the Volvo S40 and V40.

In 1996, the Volvo C70 Coupe was presented to the public. This coupe, followed by the Volvo C70 Cab, was assembled at the Uddevalla plant, which Volvo owned together with Tom Walkinshaw Racing.

In 1997, the V70 Cross Country was launched. In 2000, the second-generation Volvo V70 2000 was released, built on a larger platform. At the same time, the Volvo Cross Country car appeared.

The Volvo S80, which was shown in had a power output of 272 hp, as well as an inflatable curtain IC and WHIPS whiplash protection system - the world's first safety features of this type and in 2000 this model was recognized as the safest car in the world.

In 1999 the passenger car division of Volvo Cars was sold to Ford Motor Company.

In 2000 the third model created on a large platform, the sporty Volvo S60, was released.

In Detroit in 2002 the premiere of SUV - Volvo XC90 took place.

"Volvo" has gained a reputation as a manufacturer of expensive, prestigious, reliable and safe cars (the company's role in the development and implementation of modern safety systems is widely known, for which the company has been repeatedly awarded international prizes).
