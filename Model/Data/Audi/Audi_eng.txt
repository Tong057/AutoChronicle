The history of the Audi brand is an exciting journey of innovation and the pursuit of excellence in the world of automotive manufacturing. It all began in 1885 when August Horch founded his first company in Zwickau, Germany. However, in 1909, due to insurmountable difficulties, he had to leave his first venture.

Horch didn't give up, and in 1910, he established a new company â€“ Audi Automobilwerke GmbH. Soon after, the Audi brand gained prominence thanks to its outstanding technical solutions. In 1932, the company merged with three other German automakers, forming the Auto Union. It was during this period that the legendary racing car Auto Union Type C was born.

The post-World War II era was challenging, but despite the hardships, Audi continued to innovate. In 1965, the Audi 72 was introduced, the first mass-produced car with front-wheel drive and a steel body. This was a revolutionary moment for the automotive industry.

In the 1980s, Audi continued to showcase excellent engineering with the introduction of the Quattro models, which brought the company success in rallies and on the roads. In 1994, the Audi brand became part of the Volkswagen Group, enhancing its financial stability and expanding its product lineup.

The 21st century brought even more technological advancements to Audi, including the introduction of hybrid and electric engines. Models such as the Audi A3 e-tron and Audi e-tron GT highlight the company's commitment to a sustainable future and high performance.

Today, the Audi brand not only embodies luxury and style in the automotive world but also actively introduces cutting-edge technologies, making cars more environmentally friendly and intelligent. This is a story of constant pursuit of innovation and excellence that has made Audi one of the leading automotive brands globally.
