Founded in 1946 by an enterprising engineer Soichiro Honda as "Honda Technical Research Institute" and initially produced small engines and mopeds based on them. In 1948, the Institute was transformed into a company with the modern name, which focused initially on the production of quickly becoming famous motorcycles.

Honda fully devoted himself to production technology, and Fujisawa to corporate management.

In 1948, the company began production of motorcycles: in 1949 was released model "Dream" ("Dream") with a two-stroke 98-cubic-inch engine, which embodied all the dreams of its creators. Simultaneously with the launch of this model on the market a new approach to sales organization was developed: from now on the company appointed distributors to sell certain products in a certain territory, which in turn developed a dealer network.

The next important step in the company's history was the creation of a new four-stroke engine (1952) and a new motorcycle (1953) based on it. Already in 1955 the company "Honda Motor Co., Ltd." begins to lead in annual production volume in the domestic market of Japan.
