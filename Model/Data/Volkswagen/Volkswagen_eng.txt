"Volkswagen AG" (Volkswagen AG), German automobile concern. Produces cars, trucks, and vans. The headquarters are located in Wolfsburg.
In 1934 Ferdinand Porsche (Ferdinand Porsche), a famous German designer (founder of the world-famous German automobile company Porsche AG), received an order from the National Socialist government of Germany to develop a modern passenger car.

And already in 1935 such a car was assembled. It was named "Volkswagen", which literally translated from German means "people's car". After two years of testing, the VW30 series was launched in 1937, and by 1938 the car had acquired the familiar appearance of many generations. Volkswagen was immediately appreciated by designers, engineers and drivers. It was talked about, there were numerous publications, in 1938 in an article in the New York Times Volkswagen dubbed for the external similarity of the "beetle". This nickname so caught on that it became a trademark of the car.

For the production of "people's car" May 26, 1938 in the city of Wolfsburg began construction of the largest European car factory Volkswagen. But the impending war prevented the production of this car. Only a dozen of them were produced. Fascist bosses liked the car very much. Hitler himself rode on it with pleasure.

During World War II, work on the construction of Volkswagen was suspended, and the unfinished plant was converted to the production of military products.

After the end of the war, the enterprise came under the control of the British, in whose zone of occupation was Wolfsburg. In the fall of 1945, the British authorities gave the plant an order for 20 thousand cars. But only almost ten years later began serial production of the car in its original modification. In 1947 Volkswagen was exhibited at the export fair in Hanover and attracted a lot of attention. The plant received the first foreign order from Holland for a thousand cars, and in 1948 began to receive orders from Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden and other countries.

In January 1948, the management of Volkswagen changed, its general director was Heinrich Nordhoff, a representative of a new generation of German technocrats. The renewed management consisted of graduate engineers with international experience of working in car factories and able to think outside the box. With their arrival, the car was improved and modernized. In 1949, models with a new type of body - cabriolet and limousine - began to be produced. In serial production, the interior equipment became more comfortable, a partially synchronized engine was installed.

A network of car service and technical stations for car maintenance was established. Constant work with Western customers was carried out. Volkswagen created a powerful car sales network.

By the end of 1948 the export of the world-famous car amounted to about 50 thousand cars, about 15 thousand cars were sold on the domestic market.

By this time, the plant was freed from Allied control of the British, and September 6, 1949 Volkswagen was fully transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany.

A new phase of the plant's development began, which was primarily marked by an intensive increase in production and sales.

By 1950, 100 thousand cars were produced, by 1951 - 500 thousand cars, and on August 5, 1955 a ceremony was held to celebrate the production of the millionth Volkswagen 2. The motto of this time in the life of Germans becomes a popular phrase associated with Volkswagen - "He's a member of my family".

Proven over the years reliability and affordable price of the car strengthened the export opportunities of the car. Volkswagen is already sold in 150 countries around the world. Appear subsidiary companies abroad - in 1953 in Brazil, in 1956 in South Africa, in 1957 in Australia, in 1964 in Mexico (here since 1998 is produced "Beetle", which has become a real hit of the season with Hollywood stars) and other countries.

The first modification of the standard Volkswagen-1200 in 1955 was a sports coupe Karmann-Ghia, whose brand was made up of the names of the firms that created it: the body was designed by the Italian company "Ghia", and it was assembled at the German body firm "Karmann" in Osnabr√ºck. In 1961, the program was supplemented by a new Volkswagen-1500 with a sedan body and a larger displacement engine, on the basis of which produced the next versions of coupe and cabriolet Karmann-Ghia.

In 1965, Volkswagen bought out the company "Daimler-Benz" firm Audi, creating a concern Volkswagen-Audi, known by the abbreviation VAG. Later it included the Spanish firm SEAT (SEAT) and the Czech plant Skoda (Skoda). Currently, "Audi AG" - a subsidiary of the concern "Volkswagen", which is given full autonomy.

The first result of the merger in 1968 was the VW-411 with an air-cooled engine with a working volume of 1679 cc. The model was very discreetly received by customers. In 1969, after the accession of NSU, the first Volkswagen with front-wheel drive wheels appeared, which received the index "K-70". It could be purchased with engines with a working volume of 1,594 or 1,795 cc. In 1969-1975, in cooperation with Porsche, Volkswagen-Porsche-914" sports cars with 4- and 6-cylinder engines in 1679 and 1991 cc were produced. In 1970, the VW-181 appeared with a utilitarian open body, reminiscent of wartime army vehicles. Its development in 1979 became a lightweight all-wheel drive army vehicle lltis.

The ancestor of the new generation of Volkswagen is considered to be the front-wheel drive Passat, released in 1973. It was offered in numerous variants with engines with displacement from 1297 to 1588 cc. The following year came the sporty Scirocco with a 3-door coupe body and engines ranging from 1093 to 1588 cc, as well as the compact 3- and 5-door hatchback Golf. In the first 30 months of production, 1 million Golfs rolled off the assembly line, making Volkswagen one of the largest car manufacturers in Europe. In 1979, the Golf convertible was introduced, which was consistently in high demand.

Model Golf I, which appeared in 1974, was the most successful: modern, economical, reliable, it was such a model could shake up the international market. Golf marked a new stage of competition in the production of compact cars, which became almost officially called "Golf class". If during the development of new models in 1973-1974 the losses of the concern exceeded 800 million German marks, then in 1975 due to the great demand for them managed to cover all costs. Just 3 years after the launch of Golf I, the millionth car of this brand was produced. In 1983, the Golf II was launched, and eight years later, in 1991, the Golf III debuted, which, like the previous models, maintained the high reputation of the Golf. In the twenty-three years since its launch, 17 million Golfs of the three generations have been produced. In 1995-1996, the Golf III was the top-selling model in Europe. In 1997, the new Golf IV made its debut, with more than 60,000 orders taken in the first few days alone.

In early 1975, the "little brother" Golf was presented - a three-door front-wheel drive Polo, similar in design to the Audi-50 and offered with 895-1272 cc engines. The inexpensive and practical Polo also became very popular and strengthened Volkswagen's financial position. On the basis of the Polo was offered a three-volume version with a sedan body Derby.

Since 1980, on the basis of Golf was produced model Jetta with a 4-door sedan body. In 1992, it was replaced by a similar car (already on the third generation Golf chassis), called Vento.

In 1981, the Passat and Scirocco were modernized, and a year later on the basis of the Passat appeared a sedan Santana, which was equipped for the first time with a 5-cylinder gasoline S engine with a working volume of 1994 cc.

In the period 1988-1995, the only 3-door coupe Corrado, the successor of Scirocco, was assembled in the program.

Variant models with station wagon and convertible body on the chassis of the third generation cars continue to be produced since 1993. Two Variant Syncro models with 2.0- and 2.9-liter engines have all-wheel drive chassis.

The third-generation Polo compact model has been in production since 1994. The bodies are 3- and 5-door hatchback, Polo Classic sedan and 5-door Variant station wagon. Engines are gasoline and diesel 4-cylinder with a working volume of 1.0-1.9 liters with an output of 50-101 hp.

Comfortable family Vento of the first generation is equipped with 4- and 6-cylinder motors of 1.6-2.8 liters with an output of 75-174 hp.

The Sharan station wagon has been produced since 1995 in 5-7-seat versions, on front- and all-wheel drive chassis. Power of gasoline and diesel engines with a working volume of 1.9-2.8 liters in the range of 90-174 hp.

The family of Passat models of the fifth generation was shown in 1996. Unlike the previous cars, produced since 1988, they are again unified with the same-type Audi models "A4" and "A6". This allowed the use of more powerful and modern Audi longitudinal powertrains. Passat models are produced only with sedan and 5-door station wagon Variant bodies and are equipped with 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines in 1.6-2.8 liters with an output of 90-193 hp. Several Variant models in Syncro configuration have all-wheel drive chassis.

In 1999, a model of comfortable sedan BORA was released.

Several Volkswagen plants in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and China produce a number of models that differ significantly from European products. Among them are models "Gol" (Gol), "Parati" (Parati) and "Santana", created on the chassis of models Golf and Passat previous generations.

The Mexican branch continues production of the "1.6i" model of the Beetle type with a 1.6-liter engine with 44 hp, and since the beginning of 1998 the production of a brand new front-wheel drive car "Beetle" (Beetle) on the chassis of Golf models, similar in appearance to the famous Beetle, has been mastered.

Currently, the concern Volkswagen - one of the largest in terms of sales in the world, has its plants in 15 countries, produces products under five brands Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, SEAT. Since 1998 the concern owns the brand "Rolls-Royce". In addition to passenger cars, the plant also produces trucks and minibuses. The Volkswagen concern includes: Volkswagen AG, Audi AG, "SEAT S.
