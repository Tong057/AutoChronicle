Plymouth ("Plymouth") is one of the famous American automobile brands, specializing in the production of cars.
The Plymouth brand was founded by Walter Chrysler in 1928. At first under the name "Plymouth" it was supposed to create a range of inexpensive models "Chrysler", equipped with 4-cylinder engines and act as a competitor in the corresponding class of General Motors and Ford models. At that time, an inexpensive car "Plymouth Four" was produced, which was to replace the model "Chrysler 52".

In May 1929, a plant in Detroit was opened to produce cars under the Plymouth brand. Already in 1930 the model "Plymouth U" was sold at the same price as its classmates, but for an additional fee was equipped with a radio receiver.

A new series of cars "RA" with eight variants of bodies was released in 1931, as a result of which the company secured its reputation as a manufacturer of modern mass-market cars.

In 1932 a new series "RV" was presented. In 1933 the "P" series was equipped with a 6-cylinder engine with an output of 70 hp and automatic clutch, which worked as soon as the driver took his foot off the accelerator pedal.

In August 1934, the millionth "Plymouth" came off the assembly line.

In 1942, the company introduced the model "14C" with increased interior volume and automatic lighting when the door was opened. Subsequently, there was a model "15S", which served as a base for the creation of all cars produced until 1949.

During the Second World War, production was directed to military needs and production of cars was resumed in 1945.

In 1949 the company presented the models "P17 De Lux", "P18" and "P18 Special De Lux".

Commercial success, which accompanied the Plymouth models for 20 years, began to fade slowly and by the early 50's the company remained only in fifth place in car sales. The situation changed in 1955, when under the leadership of Virgil Exner began to change the style of the entire range of the company. For the first time in the history of the brand there were cars with 8-cylinder V-shaped engine.

In 1957, the super-popular "Flight Sweep" series of cars was released. The company takes the third place in the USA by the volume of sold products.

In the 60's in the range of the company appeared models with load-bearing bodies. In 1962 the last models designed by Exner for Plymout appeared on the market: Belvedere, Fury, Satellit. But this year turned out to be the worst year for Plymouth: although a strong demand for compact cars had been predicted earlier, the market was in fact again focused on large cars. Sales of the cars plummeted. Fortunately, thanks to the popularity of the Valiant compact model, the company made a comeback.

In 1964, the Barracuda model was launched.

The peak of popularity of the Plymouth brand was in the late 1960s - early 1970s, when they produced (and sold) up to 700 thousand cars a year. The world oil crisis forced to produce more economical models, such as Volare.

In 1971, the Sport Fury model appeared.

In 1978, a small-size model Horison was released.

The beginning of production of the new generation of Reliant cars occurs in 1980.

In 1986, the Sandance model family is launched.

In 1989, a sports model Lazer is released, which was developed together with "Mitsubishi" under the name Signum Diamond Star.

In the 90's, production of the Colt GT fastback model, front-wheel drive Acclaim LX was launched. By the end of the 1990s, there was no trace of the former glory, the models, once the cheapest and most mass-produced of all models produced by Chrysler Corporation, were losing their customers. As a result, in 1999 Plymouth production decreased to 262.9 thousand cars and the new management of DaimlerChrysler decided to close the brand due to unprofitability.

With the end of 2001 model year, the last Plymouth models - mini-van Voyager, roadster Prowler and compact sedan Neon began to be produced under the Chrysler brand.
