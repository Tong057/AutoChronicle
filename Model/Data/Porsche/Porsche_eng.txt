"PORSCHE" (Dr.Ing. h. c. Ferry Porsche AG), German automobile company. It is headquartered in Stuttgart.
The company was founded by the famous designer Ferdinand Porsche Sr. as a design bureau in 1931 in Germany. A Type 22 racing car was developed for Auto-Union in 1936. After the successful racing Auto-Union, the first variants of the future "people's car" for all times - the famous Volkswagen Beetle, which had another name -Type 60 - were born.

In 1937, the "Third Reich" needed a racing car to participate and, of course, to win the Berlin-Rome marathon, scheduled for September 1939. That's when Porsche's project received the support of the National Sports Committee. The work boiled over.

Just by this event, three prototypes of Porsche "Type-60K-10" with forced 50 "horses" engine (instead of the standard 24 hp) were built on the same base of "Beetle", or more precisely "KdF" (the name until 1945). But this model was prevented by the war.

The war years were given to the fulfillment of government orders - production of staff cars, amphibious vehicles, tanks and self-propelled guns.

In post-war Germany in 1948 the company launched the first car under the name "Porsche" - a small sporty "Porsche 356" with a boosted Volkswagen engine and a streamlined coupe. Not having had time to take its first steps, the car was able to win a race just a week after its "birth". Serial cars "Porsche-356" were already rear-engined. The "356" was produced until 1965 and served as a base for the Carrera model ("Carrera").

Taking into account the advantages and good results shown in 1951 by the model "356", Ferri tries to build a purely sports car. It became in 1953 "Porsche-550 Spyder". It was this car that repeatedly won one victory after another. Thanks to its participation (and victory) in the auto race "Carrera Panamericana" in Mexico in 1953, it became customary to name the fastest models of the company by this name.

By 1954 the first "Spyder" with a straight windshield and soft top appeared.

The very first "Porsche-Carrera" saw the light in 1955. In addition, this modification received a power plant, fully developed by the specialists of the "Porsche" company. The same "heart" was transplanted to the model "550". After that, the laurels fell on the creators of the car.

The coming year 1956 brought two events at once: there was an updated version of the "356th" - the model "356A"; a more "quiet" modification "550A" appeared in the sports range.

Two years later, a completely new, both externally and internally, racing model "Porsche-718" was born. At the end of 1958, the much-loved "Spyder" came to an end. Its place was taken by a more powerful model "356D".

In 1960, the last version of the dynasty of "550s" - the model "718/RS" was presented. In parallel, there was a closed version of the joint development of "Porsche" and Italian "Abarth".

As for the production cars, the most important step in the development of the range of models was "Porsche-356B", which was easily recognizable by high bumpers with large vertical "bulls". The car had three modifications. The most powerful one was "Super 90".

In 1961, the model "356 GS Carrera" successfully performed in the races of "Gran Turismo" class. In the spring, the last and fastest car from the "Carrera" family appeared - "Carrera-2".

In 1963, a few more changes were made, and the model "356C" appeared.

For about 15 years, the Porsche 356 was one of the most prestigious sports cars in the world. However, over time it also became less and less in line with modern requirements. There was a need for something completely new, to match the time. This car was another masterpiece of Ferdinand Porsche - the world famous "Porsche-911". Ferry's son Ferdinand Alexander took part in the creation of this car. The new car was first shown to the public at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1963.

In the world of sports, too, there was a worthy replacement. The successor of the models "RS Spyder" and "356 GS Carrera" was "904 GTS", which had the features of a racing car. These features found their continuation in the next model - "906", created in 1966. In turn, it became the ancestor of a large series of cars, which in the late 60's achieved many successes in prototype competitions (models "907", "908" and "917") and were characterized by exceptional reliability and good style.

In 1965, a cheaper modification of "Porsche-912" with a 4-cylinder engine "Super-90" was released.

In 1967, the "Porsche-911 Targa" finally went on sale. Buyers were now offered a coupe, "Targa" model (index "T" in the model name), a luxury model, which had the marking "E" and a modification "S" - especially for the U.S., where the company was returning after a year's absence.

In 1975, the model "Porsche-924" was released, which was considered the most economical in the world among sports cars.

In 1979, a more powerful model "928S" with a 300 hp engine appeared. The speed of the car reached 250 km/h, which exceeded the maximum speed of the "924" model by 20 km/h.

In 1981, the further development of the 924 model was "Porsche-944". 220 hp also affected the speed - 250 km/h.

Three years later, the prototype of the next masterpiece of minds - model "959" was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Having collected everything possible and impossible, it embodied the most modern sports car from "Porsche".

During the whole decade the class of prototypes was replenished with new successful models: "936", "956" and "962", which repeatedly collected laurels in the races "24 Hours of Le Mans", "959" reigned in the marathon "Paris - Dakar".

To introduce diversity and, to an even greater extent, to increase popularity in 1988, the "Porsche-944 S2 Cabriolet" was presented to the motoring public.

In the late 80s, the 911 Spyder was introduced. It took three decades before the name "Spyder" was reanimated. As for the turboversion, it saw the light already in the new decade, to be exact - in 1991.

In 1992, the "Porsche" family was replenished with one more model with an engine in front - "968". It replaced the whole range of 944, which by this time ceased to be produced.

Another gift of Porsche designers was the debut in 1993 at the Frankfurt Motor Show of a new generation of "911" model - type 993. Two years later appeared "Porsche" with 408-horsepower opposition turbo engine. In the same year, the models "928" and "968", which did not justify the hopes, finished their way.

In 1995, the model range of Porsche was supplemented by an unusual at first glance "Porsche-911 Targa" with a glass roof, retractable with the help of an electric drive under the rear window.

To consolidate its post-crisis position in the market of sports cars and in the class of "inexpensive" cars, in 1996 Porsche presented a completely new type of car - the Boxster model. The model has a soft (automatically folding) top. On request, you can get a variant with a hard top. At last there was a "cheap" competitor of the great "911".

July 15, 1996 was a significant day in the history of the company: the millionth Porsche was produced. It was "911 Carrera" in police version.

As for the field of experimental developments of the company, its concept cars, there were very few of them. First of all, it is "Porsche-Panamericana" (1989) with a completely new body "a la "Targa", which found its application in the modern model "911" with the same body, then "Porsche-Boxter" (1993), which later influenced the birth of the serial version, and the project "C88" (1994), which embodied another idea of "people's car" for the People's Republic of China.

"The highlight" of 1999 is the GT3 (in the 996 body), which replaced the Spartan RS. Now in all road car races and club races, the GT3 takes the lead. In terms of dynamics, this model comes close to the great "turbo" - 4.8s.

The following year sees the triumph of a new turbo based on the 996 model. With a modest 420 horsepower, it reaches a hundred in 4.2 seconds. And confirms its direct relation to the rank of supercars.
