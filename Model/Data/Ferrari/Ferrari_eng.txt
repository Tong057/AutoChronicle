"Ferrari", Italian company specializing in the production of racing and luxury cars. Since 1989 it has been a subsidiary of the FIAT concern. Its headquarters are located in Maranello.
The company (its original name was Auto Avio Costruzioni) was founded in 1939 by the famous racer and test driver of Alfa Romeo cars Enzo Ferrari. Initially it produced various equipment for automobiles. The cars made by the company were produced under the brand name "Alfa Romeo". Ferrari had a contract with this company. The first car bearing the name "Ferrari" appeared in 1946. It was a model Ferrari 125, with a powerful 12-cylinder aluminum engine, designed to realize the dream of its creator: to give an ordinary road car racing properties without compromising comfort. As a trademark of the company Enzo Ferrari chose a galloping stallion on a yellow background.

By the end of 1947 there were already two modifications of the engine "Ferrari", and its displacement increased in the model 166 to 1995 cm. The following year, the Ferrari team won the Mille Miglia and Targa Florio races for the first time. The year 1949 also brought the team a new triumph in the same events, and later a victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

In 1951, the stage model 340 America appeared with an engine originally developed for the Ferrari GT with a displacement of 4.1 liters. In 1953, the same car is equipped with a 4.5 liter engine and receives a new name - 375 America. In the same year, Ferrari introduces the 250 Europa, with a three-liter engine.

In total, by the beginning of 1954 Enzo Ferrari produced about 200 of his cars in the exclusive-road version and 250 racing models. Creating his road cars, Ferrari turned to different design companies, making his models different from each other. But the 250 GT model of 1954 marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation with the Pininfarina company, which adapted its bodies to the new short-wheelbase chassis, in which the drive rear axle was suspended on springs.

Already the 250 GT was produced not only as a coupe, but also as a convertible, and the 250GT California, which appeared in 1959 and was produced to order, was a striking example of the open 250 GT sports model. In 1958 Pininfarina created for the 250 GT a specifically angular body: these cars, equipped with a 12-cylinder engine, gave the impression of enormous power, perfectly obedient to the wishes of its owners.

Models 375 America and its successor in 1956 410 Super America (only 14 of them were produced) were intended for the "powerful of this world": their design inspired a sense of strength and self-confidence.

From 1957 to 1962, a modified Ferrari 250 GT California was produced with a predatory pointed profile and removable roof. This car scored its first victory in the 1960 Tourist Trophy race at the Goodwood circuit.

"Ferrari" belong to the most memorable cars of the 60's of our century: 250GT in 1960 was transformed into a fastback 250GTE with a body "2+2", elegant and popular, on the basis of which in 1964 was created 330GT "2+2" with a four-liter engine and original "slanting" headlights. The feminine and graceful, impetuous Berlinetta Lusso of 1962, with a top speed of over 225 km/h, remained unsurpassed. The 330GT "2+2" was replaced in 1967 by the 365GT "2+2" with self-balancing rear suspension and power steering. In 1971 it was replaced by a more austere 365GT4 in accordance with the spirit of the time.

In 1966, the company developed a new V-twin engine, which had its origins in racing engines: 12-cylinder, four cam, with two camshafts in each cylinder head, dry sump lubrication system, providing high torque and flexibility, with a power output of 300 hp.

In 1968, Ferrari released the legendary Daytona, or 365GTB/4, with a front-mounted 4.4-liter V-twin 12-cylinder engine, 352 hp, developing a top speed of 282 km/h. This model, outwardly restrained and functional, is the world's fastest car and, of course, the advertising assessment of it as "the best in the world" is not so far from the truth.

The early 1970s saw the introduction of the "Dino", named after Commendatore's deceased son, with a center-mounted engine produced by FIAT-a V-shaped 6-cylinder engine; the model was also available in an 8-cylinder version, but the 6-cylinder is considered a classic. At one time "Dino" was actually a separate brand. The car "Dino-206GT" was produced since 1967 with a V6 engine (1987 cm3 180 hp at 8000 rpm; since 1969 - "246 GT"-2418 cm3, 195 hp at 7600 rpm). Exactly the same, unconventional for "Ferrari" motors were on the sporty "Fiat Dino".

Exactly the same, unconventional for "Ferrari" motors were on the sporty "Fiat Dino".

Model 365GT4, or Berlinetta Boxer, produced in 1971, had many features of Ferrari racing cars: its 4.4 liter engine could reach a speed of 275 km/h; it was located horizontally in the middle of the body, and the gearbox for more rational use of the internal volume of the body was located under the engine. The chassis also used the experience of racing cars: space tubular frame and steel body panels. On the basis of Ferrari 308GT4 were made elegant models with bodies "Pininfarina"; equipped with V-shaped 8-cylinder engines, they attracted the attention of buyers until the early 80s.

By installing the horizontal 12-cylinder Boxer engine from the 512BB racing model in the Testarossa, the company created a massive heavy machine that met the most demanding requirements of both sports racers and celebrity customers. The Pininfarina's striking, eye-catching design carried the quintessential advertising spirit, and its creator did not just go for looks: the ribbed side air intakes, which found many imitators, served to supply air to the side radiators that replaced the 512BB's front radiator. The technical performance of the model was also impeccable: the five-liter Testarossa engine, with four valves per cylinder, achieved 390 hp and a top speed of 274 km/h.

In 1987, the company's founder Enzo Ferrari himself led the team of designers who prepared the F40, described as "the sum of the company's efforts over the years". The F40 traces its origins to the 1984 GTO and, at first glance, has much in common with the Ferrari 308GTB, but has significant technical innovations: turbocharging, V-shaped 8-cylinder engine longitudinal (rather than transverse), mounted on a tubular frame, reinforced with load-bearing panels made of Kevlar, super power of 478 hp. - all suggest that only the configuration has remained the same. The body of this supermodel is made of carbon fiber and Kevlar, and its cramped interior quite meets the sporty essence of the car: it does not even have a mechanism for adjusting the seats. Amazing technical characteristics and no comfort is the motto of 1118-kilogram Ferrari F40: the rigid suspension did not absorb road bumps, the steering wheel responded to every pothole, and the magnificent motor demonstrated endless power. Demanding, irrepressibly energetic and attractive - such was the last child of the founder of the company.

Ferrari cars, controlled by FIAT since 1969 and finally taken over by the corporation in 1989, have the reputation of being the most expensive in the world. Each of them is a legend.

At the motor show in Paris, which took place in September 2003, the Italian firm Ferrari showed the most powerful serial car in Europe. It is about a special model "Enzo Ferrari". The appearance of the special model in honor of the famous designer is intended to remind the automotive world of the advanced Ferrari design school, which is convincingly confirmed by outstanding successes in Formula 1. The two-seater sports car was equipped with a 12-cylinder engine with a capacity of 6 liters and 650 hp. Acceleration time to 100 km / h is only 3.5 seconds, and one kilometer the car is able to overcome in 19 seconds. The maximum speed of "Enzo Ferrari" is over 350 km/h. The design of the car was developed by the famous body atelier Pininfarina. The model "Enzo Ferrari" bears the features of Formula 1 bolides - streamlined body and narrow interior.
