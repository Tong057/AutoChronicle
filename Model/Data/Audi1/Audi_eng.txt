Audi, a German company specializing in the production of passenger cars, is part of the Volkswagen Group. The headquarters are located in Ingolstadt.

The company Audi was founded in 1909 by August Horch. Its roots trace back to the no longer existing but historically renowned firm Horch ("Horch"), which shone in the German sky during the time of the Third Reich. In 1899, the talented inventor August Horch established the firm "Horch und Company" in Mannheim, which moved to Zwickau after four years. In 1909, he built a new, rather unsuccessful 6-cylinder engine, which almost led the company to the brink of bankruptcy. This greatly angered his partners, who decided to deal with the ambitious inventor and expel him from his own company. However, Horch immediately founded another company nearby, which naturally bore the name "Horch." His former associates, sensing a strong competitor in the young firm, took Horch to court demanding a name change. According to the court's decision, the new automobile manufacturing enterprise could not bear the name Horch, so August Horch turned to the Latinized version of the previous name: the German word "horch," meaning "listen," became Audi. Thus, in 1909, the famous brand and equally renowned company "Audi" were born.

The first car under the name Audi-A was released in 1910. The following year saw the introduction of the Audi-B model. In June 1911, Horch presented three such cars at the first Auto Alpenfahrt race in the Austrian Alps, covering about 2500 km, replacing the famous races for the prize of German Prince Heinrich.
In 1912, the most famous model, the Audi Type C, was introduced. In the same year, its initial samples underwent rigorous testing at the Alpine Races, achieving commendable results. This led to the cars of the C series being referred to as "Alpenziger" or "Conqueror of the Alps."

During the 1920s, Audi teetered on the brink of bankruptcy and had to merge with another company.

In 1928, the company was acquired by the German DKW (DKW), with Jorgen Skafte Rasmussen becoming the owner of Audi.

The economic crisis in 1932 prompted several German firms to form the Auto Union ("Auto Union") conglomerate. It included former rivals, DKW and Wanderer, alongside "Horch" and "Audi." The conglomerate released two models equipped with front-wheel drive and Wanderer engines, and these cars sold well until the beginning of World War II.

After World War II, Audi and other partners in Auto Union were nationalized and transformed into a division of the "Association of People's Enterprises for Car Production."

In 1949, Auto Union was reformed thanks to the majority of shares acquired from Mercedes-Benz ("Mercedes-Benz").

In 1958, Daimler-Benz AG acquired a controlling stake in Auto Union, but later sold it to Volkswagen. Following the transfer in 1965 of the controlling stake to Volkswagen, the name Audi was reintroduced. Soon after this event, a new front-wheel-drive car was launched, and by the end of 1968, Audi had returned to the market with a diverse range of models and excellent sales statistics. The emblem retained four circles, symbolizing the 1932 merger of the four companies.

The "100" model, introduced in 1968, and its successors, including the renowned Audi Quattro, featured a sporty profile and all-wheel drive, marking a new milestone in the German automotive industry. The Quattro model, introduced in 1980, significantly contributed to the development of the automotive industry and brought global recognition to Audi, a subsidiary of Volkswagen. It was a lightweight, fast grand touring car with outstanding stability, serving as a rally-type vehicle. Competitors found it challenging to compete with the rallying Quattro, which performed exceptionally well in various races.

In 1969, the Volkswagen conglomerate acquired Neckarsulmer Automobilwerke (Neckarsulm Automobile Factory, NSU). As a result, the company's name changed, and it became Audi NSU Auto Union. In the summer of 1985, the company's name was transformed again to Audi AG.

From 1970, Audi embarked on extensive exports to the United States. Initially, exports to the USA were limited to the Audi Super 90 (sedan and estate) and the new Audi 100. In 1973, the Audi 80 joined them, which, unlike the European version, existed as both a sedan and an estate (Audi 80 Avant, essentially a VW Passat Variant with a higher level of equipment). Later, Audi models received their own designations in the US: Audi 4000 for the Audi 80 and Audi 5000 for the Audi 100. However, repeated instances of the manufacturer's liability violations from the mid-80s led to a decline in Audi shipments to the USA.

In 1980, an all-wheel-drive sports coupe attracted significant attention at the Audi stand at the Geneva Motor Show. For the first time, a passenger car with high power and full-drive concept, previously used only in trucks and SUVs, was offered as the Audi quattro. The idea for such a passenger car emerged in the winter of 1976/77 during test drives of the VW Iltis, an off-road vehicle developed for the German military. The excellent performance of this vehicle on ice and snow led to the decision to implement the full drive of the VW Iltis into the production Audi 80. Additionally, a high-power variant was developedâ€”a five-cylinder turbocharged engine with 2.2 liters of capacity, introduced in the fall of 1979, producing 147 kW / 200 hp.

In 1982, the Audi 80 quattro marked the start of large-scale production of permanent all-wheel drive. Gradually, the quattro concept was also offered for other Audi model series.

On the basis of the Audi 80, a sports coupe (Audi Coupe) was produced, which debuted in late 1993. The convertible version was first presented in Geneva in 1991. This veteran of the Audi family was discontinued in the mid-2000s, with approximately 72,000 units produced by 1992.

In December 1990, the new Audi 100 (internal designation C4) was introduced, becoming the first in the company's history to be offered with a V6 engine. The compact (128 kW, 174 hp) powerful unit with a engine capacity of 2.8 liters was the shortest and lightest in its class.

The Audi A4 succeeded the Audi 80, produced from 1986 to 1994. It was first introduced in October 1994.

In 2001, the A4 Avant wagon and A4 Cabriolet coupe-convertible were unveiled. The latter featured a folding hardtop (like the Mercedes-Benz SLK) and was likely to be assembled at the Karmann factory.

The Audi A8, the flagship of the Audi lineup, was first unveiled in February 1994.

In May 1994, the five-seater RS2 Avant was presented with a 2.2-liter 315-horsepower fuel-injected turbocharged engine.

The Audi A3 model was created on the Golf IV platform. The first presentation of the model took place in June 1996, and production of the Audi A3 began in 1997.

The Audi A6 was first presented with a sedan body at the Geneva Motor Show in 1997. In February 1998, the A6 Avant model with an estate body was introduced. All C4 platform models were discontinued in the summer of 1997 in connection with the introduction of the completely new A6 (4B-type).

From the conceptual presentation of the Audi A2 in the fall of 1997 until the start of serial production (beginning of 2000), just over two years passed. This gave Audi a new family of compact cars in the European size class B.

AUDI S4/S4 Avant/RS4, a high-performance sports modification of the Audi A4 with a 2.7-V6-Biturbo engine, was first presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1997. In 1999, the RS4 Avant modification with a 2.7-V6-Biturbo engine (380 hp) was introduced.

In the fall of 1996, "sporty" configurations S6/S6 Avant were introduced.

The Audi TT sports car with a coupe body was first presented in Geneva in September 1998, and the roadster version was introduced in August 1999. The prototype of the model was presented in 1995 at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

AUDI S3, a sports modification of the Audi A3 with a 1.8 20V turbocharged engine and all-wheel-drive transmission, offering high power, was first presented in March 1999.

AUDI S8, a high-performance sports modification of the Audi A8 with a 4.2 V8 engine and all-wheel drive, was first shown in early 1998.

The Audi Allroad, a model of an SUV based on the A6 Avant, was first presented in February 2000.

Currently, Audi, as part of the Volkswagen conglomerate, is experiencing significant growth. This success has been made possible by the company's new developments.
