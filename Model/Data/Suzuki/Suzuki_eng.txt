"Suzuki" (Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd.), a Japanese company specializing in the production of small and compact off-road vehicles. It is headquartered in Hamamatsu. By 2001, one-third of the stock was owned by General Motors.
Suzuki was founded by Michio Suzuki (Machio Suzuki) in the small village of Hamamutsu on the coast of Japan in 1920 and was engaged in the production of looms. A small car project was started in 1937, and by 1939 several compact prototype cars were completed. Development of the project was halted when the government declared that civilian passenger cars were an "unimportant commodity" and Suzuki ordered a halt to production.

At the end of the war, Suzuki's eye turned again to automobile construction. The result was a motorized bicycle called the Power Free. Designed to be inexpensive and easy to build and maintain, the Power Free was powered by a 36cc two-stroke engine. An unprecedented feature was the two-sprocket mechanism system, which allowed a person to use the pedals to assist the engine, or disconnect the pedals and travel with the engine alone.

By 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and changed the company name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. After the success of the first motorcycles, Suzuki created its first automobile: the 1955 Suzulight. The car included radical innovations such as front and all-wheel drive, independent suspension, and pinion-rack steering. Four decades later, these features became standard on cars around the world.

The end of the 70s was marked by the appearance of the original all-wheel drive microcar Jimny, equipped with 3-cylinder engines with displacement of 539 and 797 cubic centimeters. An improved version of the Jimny series "SJ410" was introduced in 1981. The car was exported to many countries for a number of years.

In 1977, Suzuki began manufacturing engines for power boats. By the 1980s, Suzuki was selling a full line of two-stroke engines, ranging from a modest 2 hp to a mighty 225 hp. Along the way, Suzuki introduced a number of major technological advances: computerized engine management to ensure optimal engine performance. Suzuki was the first company to offer a three-year limited warranty, the longest ever offered for a marine engine.

In 1981, the first Alto model was launched. For the European market, the car is powered by a one-liter, four-cylinder engine rated at 54 hp. To order the car is made with a five-speed gearbox or with a three-speed automatic. Since the fall of 1994, this model is made in India. To attract customer demand, the 5-door hatchback is sold at the price of a 3-door hatchback.

Since 1982, the production of a new generation of microcars Fronte/Alto/Cervo with 2-, 3- and 5-door bodies and 3-cylinder engines with an output of 29-40 hp is mastered.

In 1983, a passenger car Cultus (Swift) with a liter engine is launched on the market. Swift model cars are produced for the European market in Hungary at the Suzuki plant. Production of the Swift was noticeably reduced and now only 3- and 5-door hatchbacks are produced in GLS and GC variants with an economical 1.0-liter engine with an output of 53 hp.

In 1985, Suzuki made a major breakthrough by introducing the car line to the United States. For 30 years, Suzuki built Japan's reputation as a maker of world-renowned small cars. Suzuki introduced the 4WD Samurai, a model with all-wheel drive transmission, to the American market. Suzuki Samurai were snapped up by hundreds of thousands of Americans who wanted a sporty and practical means of transportation.

In 1988, such a famous Suzuki model as the Escudo (Vitara) appeared, equipped with a 1.6-liter engine with 95 hp and all-wheel drive. The Vitara model is characterized by a variety of names and executions. In the U.S. the car is known as Geo Tracker, in Japan - as Escudo. The car is available with three- or five-door bodies, with soft or hard top. A long-wheelbase five-door "station wagon" Vitara Long is also produced, which is equipped with the type of engine at the customer's request.

The 1990s began with the change of the company's name to Suzuki Motor Corporation. The model lineup was updated and expanded: in 1991 the production of a small 2-seater car Cappuccino began.

In 1993, the Wagon R model appeared, production and sales began in Egypt, a joint venture was signed in China, and a plant was opened in Hungary. In the following year, 1994, the total number of cars produced in Japan reached 10 million.
