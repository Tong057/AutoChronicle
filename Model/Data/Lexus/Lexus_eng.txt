"Lexus" (Lexus) is a Japanese automobile company specializing in the production of passenger cars. It is a division of Toyota Motors Corporation Headquarters is located in the city of Toeta.
The firm specializes in the production of high-end cars, mainly for the U.S. market. Lexus cars combine style, comfort and quality in equal measure.

In July 1985, the first Lexus LS 400 came off the slipway. In May 1986, it underwent extensive test drives in Germany and only in January 1989 was presented at auto shows in Detroit and Los Angeles. Since September 1989, sales of this car in the USA began.

Externally, the "Lexus LS400" - the very first Lexus - had nothing in common with Japanese cars. It was immediately made with Americans in mind. This led to the idea that someone from the famous Italian designers-carrosserists had a hand in the body. And in time this was confirmed - the later Lexus GS300 with a streamlined body was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. One of the most prestigious models of the company is a sports sedan GS 300 3T with a boosted engine developed by the Cologne branch of Motosport of Toyota.

In February 1990, the American press called the luxury sedan Lexus LS 400, characterized by power and at the same time economical due to successful aerodynamics, the best imported car in the United States.

In May 1991, a second Lexus went into production with the index SC 400 (coupe), an export version of the Toyota Soarer for the North American market. After restyling in 1998, the exterior differences with the Toyota Soarer almost disappeared.

The five-seat Lexus ES 300 sedan was first shown in summer 1991, a special version of the Toyota Camry for the U.S. market.

The Lexus GS 300 premiered in January 1993.

In the family of Lexus cars there is a chic all-wheel drive jeep Lexus LX 450, which combines the style of a luxury executive car with the advantages of off-road Toyota Land Cruiser HDJ 80. The LX 470, a large executive all-wheel drive SUV, a luxury version of the Toyota Land Cruiser 100, replaced the Lexus LX 450 in 1998.

In the fall of 1998, the first showing of the IS model produced by Toyota Motor Company of Japan took place. In spring 1999, the first compact model Lexus - IS 200 appeared on the European and American markets.

In 2000, the rather extensive model range of Lexus was supplemented by two new models: IS300 and LS430. Other models underwent minor changes. On Lexus GS, LS and LX appeared and became standard Brake Assist Safety System (BASS), which more accurately and evenly distributes braking forces to the wheels depending on the condition of brakes and braking conditions.

Lexus unveiled an updated version of its RX 300 SUV at the recently concluded North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The updated model was named Lexus RX 330, and has large dimensions in both length and width of the body. Now the look of this SUV has become more dynamic and modern. The updated RX 330 is equipped with a 3.3-liter V6 engine with 230 hp.
