"Chrysler (Chrysler Corporation), American automobile company specializing in the production of passenger cars Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Eagle, etc., Dodge trucks, pickup trucks, and various components. There are financial and technological departments of the corporation; electronic and aerospace products are produced. The headquarters is located in Auburn Hills (Michigan). Since 1998 the company is united with Daimler-Benz Corporation into a single concern Daimler-Chrysler.

The company was founded in 1924 by famous engineer and businessman Walter Chrysler as a result of reorganization of the company "Maxwell Motor" (which in turn absorbed "Chalmers Motor", founded in 1908) and "Willis-Overland".

In 1924 the first passenger car "Chrysler 70" with a 6-cylinder engine with a high compression ratio for those times, which had hydraulic brakes on all four wheels, was released. This car was a runaway success in the United States. More than 32,000 were sold in the first year.

In 1926, a more comfortable version of the Chrysler Foyr was produced, and then the Chrysler Imperial Six.

An extremely successful acquisition was the purchase of Dodge in 1928, which immediately made Chrysler one of the most important automobile companies in America. In the same year Plymouth and DeSoto brands were launched.

A powerful leap is made by "Chrysler" at the end of 40-50th years. In 1949, a convenient innovation - starting the car with the ignition key - appears. A number of powerful models lead the company forward in the creation of more and more powerful engines.

In 1955, Chrysler-Imperial is separated into a separate Imperial line. The company makes a strong breakthrough and begins to buy shares of European enterprises: in 1963 it buys 40% of shares of the Spanish company Barreiros Diesel ("Barreiros Diesel"), in 1964 30% of shares of the British automobile consortium Rootes Group ("Rootes Group"), in 1966-67 about 80% of shares of the French company "Simca". These firms are named respectively "Chrysler Espa√±a", "Chrysler United Kingdom", "Chrysler France" and merged later into "Chrysler Europe".

In 1970 "Mitsubishi Motors" produces under the brand name "Chrysler" small cars for sale in the United States. But the 70s become unprofitable for the company: the energy crisis and ill-conceived production policy had an impact.

In 1978 the management of "Chrysler Europe" department was transferred to the concern "Peugeot-Citroen" (Peugeot-Citroen), but still "Chrysler" was on the verge of bankruptcy. To save the company was invited famous manager Lee Iacocca, who managed to get a large loan from the federal government, proving that the closure of plants of such a giant corporation as "Chrysler" would be a national tragedy of America. Iacocca managed to bring the company to profitability by 1983.
