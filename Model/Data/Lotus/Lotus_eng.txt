Lotus is an English company specializing in the production of sports and racing cars. Since 1996 it has been owned by the Malaysian concern Proton.
The company was founded in 1953 by Anthony Collin Bruce Chapman (Collin Chapman) and was called Lotus Engineering Co. Soon the famous Lotus Seven (i.e. "seven") was created and mass production began in 1957.

In 1954, the sporty Lotus-8 for racing appeared, followed by the lighter and shorter "9" model. In 1955 Chapman even participated in the 24-hour race at Le Mans, but he suffered a setback - the car flew off the track. Creation of racing cars became more and more fascinating for the designer.

In 1955, a streamlined "Lotus-11" with a four-cylinder engine (1098 cm3) with an output of 84 hp was created, which began the career of the famous racer Graham Hill, later a two-time world champion in Formula 1. At an average speed of 160 km/h the car traveled 11.5 km on one liter of fuel.

On October 16, 1957, the Lotus Elite, an elegant coupe with a fiberglass body, was presented at the London Motor Show. The engine "Coventry-Climex" (4 cylinders, 1216 cm3) developed 76 hp at 6100 rpm (GT version - 104 hp). The light car reached 200 km/h and had excellent handling. Chapman was recognized in European automotive circles, but he aspired to the world of racing and began to build formula cars "Junior".

In 1957 the first racing car "Lotus-12" was built, which marked the beginning of the company's successful activity in the field of creating cars for F-1.

Lotus has been building formula 1 cars since 1958. But it wasn't until 1961 that the first of the cars that brought Chapman worldwide fame appeared. It was one of the lightest and most elegant F-1 cars for its time, the legendary Lotus-25. The racer was semi-recumbent, like a pilot in an airplane (Chapman's aviation experience came in handy), holding the steering wheel with outstretched arms. Jim Clark sat behind the wheel of the "twenty-fifth" - and in 1963 became the world champion! So Lotus entered the elite of motorsport. At the same time the two-seater "Elan" appeared.

In 1962, the Lotus Elite S-2 appeared.

In 1965, Clark on Lotus-38" won the famous race "Indy-500" in the States "! Sports circles began to talk about the "unbeatable combination" of Clark and the Lotus.

In 1966, Chapman began production of the Europa with a coupe body and a center-mounted engine at a new plant in Hitele, Norfolk.

In 1967, Chapman obtained exclusive rights to the beautiful Ford-Cosworth-DFV engine by Keith Duckworth, which was used to equip the Lotus-49, developed together with M. Phillip.

A year later the Lotus-56, designed by Maurice Philippe, saw the light of day. It is a curious racing car - with a gas turbine "Pratt and Whitney", moreover, all-wheel drive! The car had no clutch or gearbox. A multi-row Morse chain transmitted power to a Fergusson inter-axle differential, which divided it equally between the axles. Disc brakes were located at the main gear.

In the 60's the names of Chapman and his company were on everyone's lips, and the racing stable "Lotus" - on the first roles in formula 1. But now the first clouds were gathering over the company. April 7, 1968 on the track in Hockenheim crashed Jim Clark, a fan favorite, and the British public simply worshipped him. And yet the 1968 champion was a racer from the Chapman team - won Hill on a 435-horsepower "Lotus-49B".

And the 1970 season brought a new tragedy. In the championship of F1 unconditional leader Jochen Rindt (Jochen Rindt) on the "Lotus-72". But in practice in Monza, flying to the turn "parabolic", which is notorious, Rindt's car at a speed of 280 km / h flew off the track and hit the fence. Rindt's death shook up the public.

In the early 70s, a new sports car "Elite" with a fiberglass coupe body equipped with a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine appeared.

Chapman was the first to paint race cars in the colors of team sponsors. Black and gold "Lotus-JPS", which looked very spectacular, was completely painted in the colors of the sponsor - tobacco company "John Player Special". The Lotus-JPS was driven by Emerson Fittipaldi, the 1972 champion. Chapman once again felt triumphant. Seeing him run out onto the track (it was still possible back then), cheering on his winning drivers, everyone realized that Chapman lived for those moments.

Until 1973, about 2,900 cars of the four series were produced. And further - because of new taxes - the license for the production of the model was sold to the firm "Caterham Car Sales", which has been engaged in the sale of "lotuses" for six years.

The company did not forget about serial cars: there was an elegant Esprit ("Spirit") with a body by Giugiaro. And in formula 1 came a decline.

In the 1978 season presented "Lotus 79" with a completely new aerodynamics: "car-wing", which also had the effect of "sucking" to the road, could pass the corners faster. The engine developed 475 hp at 10,750 rpm. It seemed that everything was done for success, but ... tragedy again shadowed the triumph.

September 9 in Monza at the beginning of the race was in an accident with the second pilot of the team Ronny Peterson (Ronny Peterson). He passed away the next day.

In 1982, Colin Chapman passed away suddenly. He had worked without rest, truly exhausted, and lived only fifty-four years ...

Deprived of an ideological inspirer, an energetic leader, the company experienced a decline. True, J. Ducarouge and P. Wright designed the model "99T". The twin-turbocharged car was one of the first to be equipped with computer-controlled active suspension. On it in 1987, the young Ayrton Senna entered the top three winners of Formula 1, and the team won third place in the Constructors' Cup. But further things went worse and worse. In the 1995 season "Lotus" was no longer involved. The production of serial cars also experienced a decline.

In January 1986, the company was acquired by GM.

In 1996 it was bought by the British automobile company Proton, as a result of which Lotus has recently improved: in 1997, 2248 cars were assembled, which is three times more than in 1996. The most part of sales came to two-seat roadster Elise. Besides it, Lotus has one more model in the program - Esprit, produced since 1975 without significant changes.

Conditionally, the novelty can be called one of the modifications of Elise model with a coupe body, which received the name Exide. In fact, it is an adapted for urban conditions version of the sporty Elise, designed for circuit racing.
